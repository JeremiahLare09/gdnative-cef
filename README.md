# Chromium Embedded Framework as Godot native module

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: this module is no longer maintained since the main project has been canceled.**
**Better to use https://github.com/Lecrapouille/gdcef and/or search for "gdcef" in the Godot asset lib!** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This repository contains the Godot native module (GDNative) wrapping [Chromium
Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/Home) (CEF),
that we have named `gdcef` for our application
[Stigmee](https://github.com/stigmee). The code source of this module is made in
C++ and implements some classes wrapping a subset of the CEF API that can be
directly usable in Godot scripts (gdscript) but feel free to help us implemented
other features.

This module is compiled automatically by our application general script
[build.py](https://github.com/stigmee/install), which works for Linux and for
Windows 10 (but not yet for Mac OS) but for people who are less interested by
our application, but only desired to use the CEF in Godot, they can jump
directly to the section talking about our minimal example in this document.

The goal of this document is to make you understand the general ideas behind how
this module `gdcef` is compiled (with examples for Window while similar for
other operating systems). The detail design on how guts are working is described
in an other [document](doc/detailsdesign.md) (currently in gestation). For the
details of the implementation, you will have to dive directly inside the CEF
code source, it has lot of comments (not always easy to apprehend at first
lecture). Else, ask questions either in our Discord, or in the `Discussions` or
`Issues` menu of the associated GitHub repository to help improving this
document.

## Environment

The tree structure of the Stigmee project is a little more complex than depicted
in the next diagram: it contains folders the [Godot editor
code](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), folders for other Godot native
modules ([Stigmark](https://github.com/stigmee/gdnative-stigmark),
[IPFS](https://github.com/stigmee/gdnative-ipfs), ...), but only modules
concerning CEF will be depicted in this document. The next sections in this
document will describe these folders.

## The Godot C++ binding API (godot-cpp)

The first component, `godot-cpp` folder, must be present before doing *any*
compilation attempt on a Godot module (CEF, Stigmark, IPFS ...). This folder
comes from this [repo](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) and contains
binding on the Godot API and allows you to compile your module like if you we
were compiling it directly inside the code source of the Godot editor (see
[here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/cpp/custom_modules_in_cpp.html)
for more information).

*IMPORTANT:* You have to know that contrary than compiling your module directly
inside the `modules` folder of the Godot engine, this method has the drawback,
each time that one of your exported functions is called, to call extra
intermediate functions imposed by the binding layer. In our case this is fine
since CEF fewly triggers the Godot engine. The other point is that methods may
have their name a little changed compared to the official API. Last good point
for us for this project, is the presence of C++ namespace which fix for us a
name conflict on the error enumerators: Godot and CEF using the same error
names, the compiler does not know which one to use. Finally, to make use CEF
natively inside Godot engine would mean to modify directly the Godot code
source, which is more complex than using C++ binding. If you are curious and
read French you can check this
[document](https://github.com/stigmee/doc-internal/blob/master/doc/tuto_modif_godot_fr.md#compilation-du-module-godot-v34-stable)
detailing how we succeeded.

The `godot-cpp` repository is cloned when the Stigmee workspace is created
thanks one of the following tool [tsrc](https://github.com/dmerejkowsky/tsrc) or
[git-repo](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/) and their associated
manifest in this [repository](https://github.com/stigmee/manifest). The repo
tool knows that it has to clone **recursively** using the appropriate branch
(i.e. do not clone the master as you would end up with headers for the 4.0
version) : `git clone --recursive -b 3.4
https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp`. Recursive cloning will include the
appropriate godot-headers used to generate the C++ bindings and will produce
this kind of message (useless information have been removed for the clarity of
this document):

```
Cloning into 'godot-cpp'...
...
Submodule 'godot-headers' (https://github.com/godotengine/godot-headers) registered for path 'godot-headers'
Cloning into '<Project>\godot-native\godot-cpp/godot-headers'...
...
Submodule path 'godot-headers': checked out 'd1596b939d6c9f5df86655ea617713ef321ad938'
```

The `godot-cpp` folder is automatically compiled by the
[install](https://github.com/stigmee/install) script `build.py` which call a
command similar to these lines:

```
cd godot-cpp
scons platform=windows target=release
```

Where [scons](https://scons.org/) is a build system like Makefile but using the
Python interpreter and the build script knowing the operating system, if to
compile in release or debug mode (and more parameters).

## Prebuilt Chromium Embedded Framework (cef_binary)

The second component, `cef_binary` contains the CEF with prebuilt libraries with
the C++ API and some code to compile. These libraries and artifacts are needed
to make the Godot application (Stigmee) compilable and working. They are created
when this component is compiled (in fact, compiling the CEF's `cefsimple`
example given in the source is enough). Note that building CEF source code 'from
scratch' is too complex: too long (around 4 hours with a good Ethernet
connection, at worst 1 day with poor Ethernet connection), too huge (around 60
and 100 giga bytes on your disk) and your system shall install plenty of system
packages (apt-get).

Since this folder `cef_binary` cannot be directly git cloned when the Stigmee
workspace is created, we have to downloaded, unpacked and renamed from the CEF
website https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/index.html in an automatic way. This
is done by our [install](https://github.com/stigmee/install) script `build.py`
which knows your operating system and the desired CEF version: an inspection
inside the CEF's README (if presents) allows to know if CEF has been previously
downloaded or if the version is matching (if not, this means we wanted to
install a different CEF version: the old `cef_binary` folder is removed and the
new one is downloaded, unpacked and compiled automatically).

To compile CEF, our build script `build.py` will call something similar to the
following lines (but depending on your operating system):

```
cd ./thirdparty/cef_binary
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
cmake --build . --config Release
```

The following libraries and artifacts shall copied into the Godot project root
`res://` else Godot will not be able to locate them and will complain about not
being able to load the module dependencies at project startup. The destination
folder is https://github.com/stigmee/stigmee inside its `build` folder (to be
created). Those files, for Windows, are mandatory to correctly startup
CEF. Again, the `build.py` will do it for you, and for other operating system.

```

For Windows, actual builds are using dynamic library, and default VS solutions
is configured for static compilation. Therefore need to use VS to compile in
Release mode, and you (the build script) will change the compiler mode of the
Release mode from `/MT` to `/MD`, and add the 2 following preprocessor flags:

* `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL = 0;`                 under `C/C++ >> Preprocessor >> PreprocessorDefinitions`.
* `_ALLOW_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL_MISMATCH`       under `C/C++ >> Preprocessor >> PreprocessorDefinitions`.

Our build script `build.py` will apply a patch before compiling. For Linux it
seems not possible to compile in static, as consequence the `libcef.so` is quite
fat: more than 1 gigabytes which is a factor more than the one for Windows
(probably because this last knows better that Linux which symbol to export).

*IMPORTANT:* since CEF is using some thirdpart libraries under the LGPL licence.
Compiling them as static libraries will contaminate the project under the GPL
licence (which it is not the case when compiled as dynamic libraries). See this
[post](https://www.magpcss.org/ceforum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=11182). In our case
this fine since our project is already under GPL licence.

## CEF secondary process (subprocess)

This executable is needed in order for the CEF to spawn the various CEF
sub-processes (GPU process, render handler...). In CEF, a secondary process is
needed when the CEF initialization function cannot reach or modify the command
line of the application (the `int main(int argc, char* argv[])`) which it is our
case since we do not want to depend on a modified Godot (forked) holding
internally a CEF. We gave a try: modifying Godot code source works but this
becomes too complex to follow evolution of Godot and CEF (since we are not
developing the Godot engine code source). For more information you can read this
[section](https://github.com/stigmee/doc-internal/blob/master/doc/tuto_modif_godot_fr.md#modification-du-main-de-godot-v34-stable).

The detail design on how the both processes talk together is described in this
[document](doc/detailsdesign.md).

The canonical path of the secondary process shall be known by the primary
process (the primary process is explained in the next section). This is our case
since this secondary process will live next to the Stigmee executable.

The code source of this secondary process is simply a simple version of the
CEF's `cefsimple` example given in the source is enough. This executable can be
directly used as it and you will have a minimal browser application.

```

```

To compile this source :

```
cd subprocess
scons target=release platform=windows workspace=$WORKSPACE_STIGMEE godot_version=3.4.3-stable -j8
```

The executable will be created as `gdcefSubProcess.exe`. It should be placed
into the appropriate our godot project https://github.com/stigmee/stigmee inside
its `build` folder (to be created). Again the `build.py` will do it for you.

```

    ‚îó üì¶gdcefSubProcess              ‚¨ÖÔ∏è CEF secondary process
```

## CEF native module (gdcef)

This directory contains the source of the gdcef library, allowing to generate
the `libgdcef.dll` module. This dll file can then be loaded by the GDNative
module (see Module configuration). The detail design is described in this
[document](doc/detailsdesign.md).

```
üì¶gdcef

```

To compile this source :

```
cd gdcef
scons target=release platform=windows -j8 workspace=$WORKSPACE_STIGMEE godot_version=3.4.3-stable -j8
```

The library `libgdcef.dll` will be generated into the build directory. It should be placed
into the appropriate our godot project https://github.com/stigmee/stigmee inside
its `build` folder (to be created). Again the `build.py` will do it for you.

```

```

## Godot module configuration

In order for native modules to be used by Godot, you have to create the
following 2 files under the the Godot project root `res://` (for example in our
case in the folder `libs`) else Godot will not be able to locate them and will
complain about not being able to load the module dependencies at project
startup.

```
üì¶Stigmee                            ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Godot res://

    ‚îó üìúlibgdcef.dll                 ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Our CEF native module library for Godot
```

- gdcef.gdns:
```
[gd_resource type="NativeScript" load_steps=2 format=2]

[ext_resource path="res://libs/gdcef.gdnlib" type="GDNativeLibrary" id=1]

[resource]
resource_name = "gdcef"
class_name = "GDCef"
library = ExtResource( 1 )
script_class_name = "GDCef"
```

This file holds information of the C++ exported class name `GDCef`, its name on
Godot and refers to the second file `gdcef.gdnlib`.

- gdcef.gdnlib:
```
[general]

singleton=false
load_once=true
symbol_prefix="godot_"
reloadable=false

[entry]

OSX.64="res://build/libgdcef.dylib"
Windows.64="res://build/libgdcef.dll"
X11.64="res://build/libgdcef.so"

[dependencies]

OSX.64=[ "res://build/libcef.dylib" ]
Windows.64=[ "res://build/libcef.dll" ]
X11.64=[ "res://build/libcef.so" ]
```

This file holds information on how to find your gdnative library and the library
it depends on.

To use the native module inside Godot, ensure libraries are correctly loaded
into your project (open the lib in the Godot editor, make sure GDCef can be
instantiated in GDScript). Then create a `Spatial` node in the scene graph and
attach to it the `gdcef.gdns` file as `NativeScript` (in the language
selector). If Godot is complaining is probably your node is incompatible. Select
the correct node.

## The Hello-CEF example

A minimal CEF example is given. We use it to prototype new API. It is
automatically compiled by the [install](https://github.com/stigmee/install)
`build.py` script. But if you not want to get all Stigmee workspace to test it,
you can call:

```
./example.py <path to Godot C++ API>
```

Where `<path to Godot C++ API>` refers to
https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp which shall have be compiled before
calling this script.
